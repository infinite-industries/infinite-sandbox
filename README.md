# Infinite Sandbox

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with a new project structure and new technologies for the Infinite Industries platform. The goal is to create a proof-of-concept for the new architecture, before we undertake the effort to convert the existing project.

The new architecture will be a monorepo unifiying the API server and web portal. The web portal will be migrated to use Vue CLI 3.
